# helidonLearning

Helidon SE application that uses the dbclient API with MySQL database.

## Build and run


This example requires a database, see [Database Setup](#database-setup).


With JDK21
```bash
mvn package
java -jar target/helidonLearning.jar
```

## Exercise the application

Basic:
```
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/simple-greet
Hello World!
```


Tracing:
```
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/traced
```


Database:
```
# List all Pokémon
curl http://localhost:8080/db/pokemon

# List all Pokémon types
curl http://localhost:8080/db/type

# Get a single Pokémon by id
curl http://localhost:8080/db/pokemon/2

# Get a single Pokémon by name
curl http://localhost:8080/db/pokemon/name/Squirtle

# Add a new Pokémon Rattata
curl -i -X POST -d '{"id":7,"name":"Rattata","idType":1}' http://localhost:8080/db/pokemon

# Rename Pokémon with id 7 to Raticate
curl -i -X PUT -d '{"id":7,"name":"Raticate","idType":2}' http://localhost:8080/db/pokemon

# Delete Pokémon with id 7
curl -i -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/db/pokemon/7
```



## Exercise Webclient

First, start the server:

```
java -jar target/helidonLearning.jar
```

Note the port number that it displays. For example:

```
WEB server is up! http://localhost:8080/simple-greet
```

Then run the client, passing the port number. It will connect
to the server:

```
java -cp "target/classes:target/libs/*" com.example.myproject.WebClientMain PORT
```



## Using CORS

The following requests illustrate the CORS protocol with the example app.

By setting `Origin` and `Host` headers that do not indicate the same system we trigger CORS processing in the
 server:

```bash
# Follow the CORS protocol for GET
curl -i -X GET -H "Origin: http://foo.com" -H "Host: here.com" http://localhost:8080/cors-greet

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Thu, 30 Apr 2020 17:25:51 -0500
Vary: Origin
connection: keep-alive
content-length: 27

Hello World
```


## Try metrics

```
# Prometheus Format
curl -s -X GET http://localhost:8080/observe/metrics
# TYPE base:gc_g1_young_generation_count gauge
. . .

# JSON Format
curl -H 'Accept: application/json' -X GET http://localhost:8080/observe/metrics
{"base":...
. . .
```


## Try health

This example shows the basics of using Helidon SE Health. It uses the
set of built-in health checks that Helidon provides plus defines a
custom health check.

Note the port number reported by the application.

Probe the health endpoints:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/observe/health
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/observe/health/ready
```


## Tracing

### Set up Jaeger

First, you need to run the Jaeger tracer. Helidon will communicate with this tracer at runtime.

Run Jaeger within a docker container:
```
docker run -d --name jaeger\
   -e COLLECTOR_ZIPKIN_HOST_PORT=:9411\
   -e COLLECTOR_OTLP_ENABLED=true\
   -p 6831:6831/udp\
   -p 6832:6832/udp\
   -p 5778:5778\
   -p 16686:16686\
   -p 4317:4317\   
   -p 4318:4318\
   -p 14250:14250\
   -p 14268:14268\
   -p 14269:14269\
   -p 9411:9411\
   jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.43
```

### View Tracing Using Jaeger UI

Jaeger provides a web-based UI at http://localhost:16686, where you can see a visual representation of
the same data and the relationship between spans within a trace.


## Building a Native Image

The generation of native binaries requires an installation of GraalVM 22.1.0+.

You can build a native binary using Maven as follows:

```
mvn -Pnative-image install -DskipTests
```

The generation of the executable binary may take a few minutes to complete depending on
your hardware and operating system. When completed, the executable file will be available
under the `target` directory and be named after the artifact ID you have chosen during the
project generation phase.



### Database Setup

In the `pom.xml` and `application.yaml` we provide configuration needed for mysql database.
Start your database before running this example.

Example docker commands to start databases in temporary containers:

MySQL:
```
docker run --rm --name mysql -p 3306:3306 \
    -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root \
    -e MYSQL_DATABASE=pokemon \
    -e MYSQL_USER=user \
    -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=changeit \
    mysql:5.7
```



## Building the Docker Image

```
docker build -t helidonLearning .
```

## Running the Docker Image

```
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 helidonLearning:latest
```

Exercise the application as described above.
                                

## Run the application in Kubernetes

If you don’t have access to a Kubernetes cluster, you can [install one](https://helidon.io/docs/latest/#/about/kubernetes) on your desktop.

### Verify connectivity to cluster

```
kubectl cluster-info                        # Verify which cluster
kubectl get pods                            # Verify connectivity to cluster
```

### Deploy the application to Kubernetes

```
kubectl create -f app.yaml                              # Deploy application
kubectl get pods                                        # Wait for quickstart pod to be RUNNING
kubectl get service  helidonLearning                     # Get service info
kubectl port-forward service/helidonLearning 8081:8080   # Forward service port to 8081
```

You can now exercise the application as you did before but use the port number 8081.

After you’re done, cleanup.

```
kubectl delete -f app.yaml
```
